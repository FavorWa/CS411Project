Idea 2) Our second idea is a spinoff of the BU Sustainability app that would make the app more fun in order to get more people to use the app. 
We would add in competitions with friends / coworkers / etc. that would resemble a board game, in which each time that you do a certain sustainable
activity, you will move forward more spaces. The number of spaces you move forward will be determined by how much energy, water, CO2, etc. that you
saved by doing the activity. This will be a more effective way of getting people to use the app because gamification is proved to increase engagement 
and interest. We could use a database by storing people's login information, we could use environmental APIs such as the Brighter Planet API to track
people's carbon footprint for tasks such as driving a car vs walking, shutting off lights, etc. For third party authentication, we could use Duo
to make sure that it is only BU students and faculty that are using the app. Finally, there will be decoupled architecture because the frontend will
be the application itself, and the backend will be all of the calculations for the game.
