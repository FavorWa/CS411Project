User Stories:
1. A user has found themselves with free time this weekend and can't think of what to do. They go to our website to get some ideas. Upon putting in
the URL, they first have to log in with Facebook. Once they get into the app, it is their first time, so they will have a suggested set 
of keywords to choose from before they see the main page of our site. They can also manually input some keywords to get started. Once they have 
chosen enough keywords, they will see the main page. On this page, the user will be able to set a radius and will see a list of recommendations 
that combine the most keywords possible (therefore being the best suggestions) and is within their given radius. The user will go to a recommended
place and then come back and can put a thumbs up or a thumbs down to better future recommendations.
