User Stories:
1. A user has found themselves with free time this weekend and can't think of what to do. They go to our website to get some ideas. Upon putting in
the URL, they first have to log in with Facebook. If they don't have a facebook, they will be able to manually log in with an account that they created 
with us. Once they get into the app, if it is their first time, then they will have a suggested set of keywords to choose from before they see the main 
page of our site. They can also manually input some keywords to get started. Once they have chosen enough keywords, they will see the main page.
On this page, the user will be able to set a radius and will see a list of recommendations that combine the most keywords possible (therefore being
the best suggestions). The user will go to a recommended place and then come back and can put a thumbs up or a thumbs down to better future recommendations.
